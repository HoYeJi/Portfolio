        <p><strong>SDG 2: Zero Hunger</strong> is a global initiative aimed at eradicating hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030. This goal strives to ensure that all people, especially the most vulnerable, have access to enough nutritious food year-round, while fostering the responsible management of our planet's natural resources.</p>
        <p>The focus of SDG 2 includes ending malnutrition in all its forms, from undernutrition to obesity, through better access to healthy food. It aims to improve agricultural productivity and incomes, particularly for small-scale farmers, and advocates for sustainable farming practices that protect the environment and maintain biodiversity. By addressing key issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change, SDG 2 seeks to create a world where no one goes to bed hungry and everyone has the opportunity to thrive.</p>
        <p>Through initiatives such as reducing food waste, supporting local food systems, and promoting the development of resilient food infrastructures, SDG 2 brings together governments, organizations, and communities to work toward a sustainable future. Together, we can build a more equitable and food-secure world for all.</p>
